# weatherDashboard

## Description
The aim of this project was to make an application that would function as a weather dashboard, allowing the user to search for a city and get back the forecast for that day and five days in the future. Their searches will also be saved into their history and available to be clicked to access the data quickly and easily. 

This was done by building on the given starter code, using the Open Weather API to gather data and icons to present to the user. I used dayjs to get the current date and time, and jQuery to add the appropriate classes to dynamically generated elements. Bootstrap was used to style the elements and buttons, as well as help to arrange them on the page. I also used event listeners and functions to set and get items from local storage, making the data persist. 

In this project, I got a lot of practice with implementing and gathering data from APIs, as well as using functions to cut down on the amount of code needed to make my applications work.
